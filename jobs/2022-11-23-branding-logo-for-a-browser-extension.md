The aim of openW2G is to enable two users to sync any kind of streaming service playback by simply sharing a room code similar to how w2g.tv works. openW2G is an ad-free open-source MIT-licensed browser extension that syncs users' clicks in their browser.
I'm looking for the extension icon/logo that will be used in the browser. If you have also experience in UI and web design feel free to send your ideas!
